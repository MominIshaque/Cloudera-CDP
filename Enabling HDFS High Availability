1. Go to the HDFS service. 
2. Select Actions > Enable High Availability. A screen showing the hosts that are 
eligible to run a standby NameNode and the JournalNodes displays. 
3. Specify a name for the nameservice or accept the default 
name nameservice1 and click Continue. 
4. In the NameNode Hosts field, click Select a host. The host selection dialog box 
displays. 
5. In the JournalNode Hosts field, click Select hosts. The host selection dialog

to act as JournalNodes and click OK. JournalNodes should be hosted on hosts 
with similar hardware specification as the NameNodes. Cloudera recommends 
that you put a JournalNode each on the same hosts as the active and standby 
NameNodes, and the third JournalNode on similar hardware, such as the 
JobTracker. 
7. Click Continue. 
8. In the JournalNode Edits Directory property, enter a directory location for the 
JournalNode edits directory into the fields for each JournalNode host. You 
may enter only one directory for each JournalNode. The paths do not need to 
be the same on every JournalNode. The directories you specify should be 
empty, and must have the appropriate permissions. 
9. Click Continue. 
10. Cloudera Manager executes a set of commands that will stop the dependent 
services, delete, create, and configure roles and directories as appropriate, 
create a nameservice and failover controller, and restart the dependent 
services and deploy the new client configuration.
