1. Go to the YARN service. 
2. Select Actions > Enable High Availability. A screen showing the hosts that are 
eligible to run a standby ResourceManager displays.  
3. Select the host where you want the standby ResourceManager to be installed, 
and click Continue.  


ResourceManager HA doesn't affect the JobHistory Server (JHS). JHS doesn't 
maintain any state, so if the host fails you can simply assign it to a new host. You 
can also enable process auto-restart by doing the following: 
1. Go to the YARN service. 
2. Click the Configuration tab. 
3. Select Scope > JobHistory Server. 
4. Select Category > Advanced. 
5. Locate the Automatically Restart Process property or search for it by typing its 
name in the Search box. 
6. Click Edit Individual Values 
7. Select the JobHistory Server Default Group. 
8. Goto Instances > JobHistory Server > Restart the JobHistory Server role.
